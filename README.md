# [dragonlance-moon-tracker](https://scottvossen.github.io/dragonlance-moon-tracker/)

I made this [Krynn Moontracker](https://scottvossen.github.io/dragonlance-moon-tracker/) from the fantasy world of Dragonlance as a tool for one of my Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.
It was a fun way to play more with data binding early on in my career via Knockout.js and do some styling with Bootstrap.
Sorry, you won't be able to see the history since I migrated the project from Bitbucket.
